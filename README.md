## Spring Boot
This project was generated with Spring Boot.
(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) 
The framework is embedded with Tomcat Server which means a server is automatically prompted when running the application.
No further installation is needed for the Spring Boot framework as it is already configured in the pom.xml. All you need to do is build/run the project.
